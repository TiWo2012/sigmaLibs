# Core Principles

### Simplicity
- Provide clear and minimal APIs.
- Offer intuitive defaults while supporting customization.

### Efficiency
- Prioritize performance, especially for core utilities.
- Use modern C++ features (e.g., `constexpr`, move semantics, smart pointers).

### Error Handling
- Use exceptions sparingly or provide an error-handling mechanism (e.g., `std::optional`, `std::variant`).

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Ensure compatibility with major platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Use abstractions for platform-specific code.

### Modularity
- Organize your library into well-defined modules.
- Allow users to include only what they need.

# Essential Features

## 1. Utility Functions
- **String Manipulation**: Splitting, joining, trimming, formatting.
- **File I/O Utilities**: Reading and writing files with simple APIs.
- **Math Utilities**: Common mathematical operations, random number generation, and linear algebra.
- **Time and Date Utilities**: Parsing, formatting, and manipulation of dates and times.

## 2. Data Structures
- Dynamic arrays, hash maps, trees, or graphs.
- Specialized containers like fixed-size arrays or circular buffers.
- Thread-safe containers if multithreading is a goal.

## 3. Algorithms
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Graph Traversal Algorithms**: DFS, BFS.
- **String Matching**: (e.g., Knuth-Morris-Pratt).
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Dynamic programming.

## 4. Memory Management
- Smart pointer utilities or custom allocators.
- Pool or arena allocators for performance-critical applications.

## 5. Concurrency
- Thread pools.
- Task scheduling.
- Thread-safe utilities like locks and atomic operations.

## 6. Logging
- A simple logging system with configurable verbosity levels.
- Output to files, console, or custom sinks.

## 7. Configuration
- Easy parsing of configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML, or TOML).
- Environment variable utilities.

# Advanced Features

## 1. Networking
- Lightweight socket abstractions for TCP/UDP.
- HTTP client/server utilities.
- WebSocket support.

## 2. Serialization
- JSON, XML, or binary serialization/deserialization support.
- Customizable serialization for user-defined types.

## 3. Cross-Platform Abstractions
- File system utilities (e.g., directories, paths).
- Process management and IPC (Inter-Process Communication).

## 4. Math/Graphics
- Vector, matrix, and quaternion operations for game or scientific applications.
- Geometry utilities (e.g., collision detection).

## 5. Plugin System
- A way to load and manage plugins (e.g., dynamic libraries).

## 6. Unit Testing
- A lightweight testing framework to encourage library users to write tests.
- Consider integrating with existing frameworks like Catch2 or Google Test.

# API Design Guidelines

- **Modern C++ Standards**: Use C++17 or later for `std::optional`, `std::variant`, etc.
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow conventions like `snake_case` or `camelCase` consistently.
- **Documentation**: Use Doxygen for API documentation and include clear examples.
- **Error Reporting**: Use exceptions or return values like `std::optional` or `std::expected`.

# Packaging and Distribution

- **CMake Support**: Provide a simple CMake-based build system.
- **Header-Only Option**: For lightweight utilities, consider a header-only library.
- **Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning to indicate API changes.
